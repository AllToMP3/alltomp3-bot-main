# AllToMP3 - Telegram bot

If you want to use AllToMP3 on Telegram, use https://github.com/AllToMP3/alltomp3-bot-client.

This repo is the main entry point of the `@AllToMP3_bot` Telegram bot.
You don't have to install this part.
Just install and configure the client.

## Disclaimer

**The bot is highly experimental.** First it lacks an easy installation (like a deb package), it crashes from time to time, doesn't work in a private chat, only in a group conversation for now, and the support of multiple daemons is not working yet...
